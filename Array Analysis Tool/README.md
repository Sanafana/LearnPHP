Things I need to do to start practicing:
create a localhost php server with php -S localhost:8888 in the code's folder in this case is: C:\Users\*USER*\Documents\GitHub\LearnPHP
open github Desktop (I think I dont need it but IÂ´ll keep doing it this way, it's simple and I can see the changes).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

so far i's only this.
