After a few days on vacation with the family i'm back here. 
I was thinking in changing to learning C++ because I used to love "programing" in C 15 years ago.
But I was just doing what I always do... start something, rememeber that I like something else and then change.. not finishing anything.
So I'm now commited to keep learning php for the next year at least.

in this 1 year I want to learn the basics of PHP and then learn the basics of Javascript so I can learn Laravel.
I don't know if it's doable, but I'm trying. 

So, what did I do today?
I used to play with C, and I made some little programs that would get user data and with that data search the arrays and do stuff.
I wanted to do that here. I coould have use the terminal, but that's not fancy xD so I used chat GPT to show me the best way to do that. and it said, use forms and gave me an example.
PS: I'm using chatGPT but only to get examples. the same way I would search in google.

that example would call a second file, so I made a second file, something that I used to do also in C, so nothing new here.
So the first File is the index.html and only gets html, the second file gets all the PHP logic.
there are somethings that I dont know what it does and I'm tempted to search each thing but I'm scared that I get into to a loop, this happened to me all the time.
for example, why do I need to do this?
$name = htmlspecialchars($_POST['fruit']); and  then I find that there is an other function inside that function that I dont know what it is... and the loop goes and goes..
so I think I'm skipping and one day I might learn it.

so I might try to divide this into functions... 
function listALL(how many vars do I need?)
function listOne(same thing)

see you tomorrow!

Sanafana!

Excuse of the week... 
Work as been killing me...
need more consistency! 

Today I strungled with updating the quantity in the array and creating the inventory calculation function.

it was simple but I'm dumb and couldn't do it for some reason.
the main issue was calling the function before the code, I just pushed those 2 functions to the beginning of the file and it worked.
thanks CHATGPT!
