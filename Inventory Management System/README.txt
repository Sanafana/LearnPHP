After a few days on vacation with the family i'm back here. 
I was thinking in changing to learning C++ because I used to love "programing" in C 15 years ago.
But I was just doing what I always do... start something, rememeber that I like something else and then change.. not finishing anything.
So I'm now commited to keep learning php for the next year at least.

in this 1 year I want to learn the basics of PHP and then learn the basics of Javascript so I can learn Laravel.
I don't know if it's doable, but I'm trying.
